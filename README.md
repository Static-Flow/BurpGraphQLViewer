# BurpGraphQLViewer
This extension provides a central location for viewing all GraphQL requests/responses within a Burp project. It provides a clean UI that groups all requests by "operationName" and for each GraphQL request shows a pretty printed view of the query and the raw Burp Suite Request/Response.
